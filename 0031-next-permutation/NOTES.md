In this corrected code, we start the first loop from n - 2 and use the condition nums[i] < nums[i + 1] to find the decreasing sequence that needs to be modified. We update the break_index accordingly.

In the second part, we find the element to swap with the element at break_index, which is the smallest element greater than nums[break_index] that appears after it. We swap these two elements and then reverse the sequence after the break_index to obtain the lexicographically next permutation.

This corrected code should correctly generate the next permutation of the given sequence of numbers.

// another approach could be using next_permutation inbuilt function of c++.
