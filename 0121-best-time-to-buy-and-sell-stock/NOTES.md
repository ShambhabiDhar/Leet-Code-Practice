here we solve using the following approach :
1. assign 2 variables min_price and max_profit 
2. initially , maxprofit=0 and minprice= maxinteger
3. firstly we get the min price by comparing between array element and min_price 
4. then max profit by comparing with maxprofit and array element-min price
