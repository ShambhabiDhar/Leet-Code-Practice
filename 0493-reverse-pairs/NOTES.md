Certainly! Let's go through the code step by step:

The code includes the necessary header files: <iostream> for input/output operations and <vector> for using the vector container.

The code defines a class named Solution. This class contains three member functions: Merge, MergeSort, and reversePairs.

The Merge function takes in a vector nums and three integers low, mid, and high. It performs the merging step of the merge sort algorithm and counts the number of reverse pairs in the given range. It uses the total variable to keep track of the total count of reverse pairs. The j variable is initialized to mid + 1 and is used to compare elements from the right subarray with the elements from the left subarray. The function iterates over the left subarray (i from low to mid) and checks if each element nums[i] forms a reverse pair with any element nums[j] from the right subarray. If a reverse pair is found, it increments j until the condition nums[i] > 2LL * nums[j] is no longer satisfied, and updates the total count accordingly. After counting the reverse pairs, the function performs the merging step by creating a temporary vector t and merging the elements from the left and right subarrays into it. Finally, it copies the merged elements from t back to the original nums vector and returns the total count.

The MergeSort function implements the merge sort algorithm. It recursively divides the input vector into smaller subarrays until each subarray has a size of 1 or less. Then, it merges the subarrays back together using the Merge function. The function returns the total count of reverse pairs obtained from the merging steps.

The reversePairs function serves as a wrapper function for the MergeSort function. It takes a vector arr as input and calls MergeSort to count the number of reverse pairs in the array. It returns the total count.

In the main function, an instance of the Solution class is created. A vector arr containing the input array {1, 3, 2, 3, 1} is created. The reversePairs function of the Solution object is called with arr as an argument to count the number of reverse pairs. The result is then printed to the console.

The code effectively uses the merge sort algorithm to count the number of reverse pairs in an array. It splits the array into smaller subarrays, recursively sorts them, and merges them back together while counting the reverse pairs. The final count is then printed to the console.

I hope this explanation clarifies the code for you. Let me know if you have any further questions!
